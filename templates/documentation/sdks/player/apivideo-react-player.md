##### Controls

The `controls` property let you decide wich controls should be displayed on the player. Here is the list of all available controls:  `play`, `seekBackward`, `seekForward`, `playbackRate`, `volume`, `fullscreen`, `subtitles`, `chapters`, `pictureInPicture`, `progressBar`, `chromecast`, `download`, `more`.


Examples
> ```tsx
{/* default: all controls are displayed */}
<ApiVideoPlayer 
 video={{id: "vi5fv44Hol1jFrCovyktAJS9"}} />

{/* all controls hidden (equivalent to chromeless=true) */}
<ApiVideoPlayer 
  video={{id: "vi5fv44Hol1jFrCovyktAJS9"}}
  controls={[]} />

{ /* only the play button & the unmute one are displayed */}
<ApiVideoPlayer 
  video={{id: "vi5fv44Hol1jFrCovyktAJS9"}}
  controls={["play", "unmute"]}/>
```

##### Player theme

The `theme` property let you customize the color of some elements on the player. Here is the list of customizable elements: `text`, `link`, `linkHover`, `trackPlayed`, `trackUnplayed`, `trackBackground`, `backgroundTop`, `backgroundBottom`, `backgroundText`, `linkActive`.

Example

```tsx
{ /* display the text in blue and the progress bar in red */}
<ApiVideoPlayer 
  video={{id: "vi5fv44Hol1jFrCovyktAJS9"}}
  theme={{
    trackPlayed: "#FF0000",
    text: "blue"
  }}/>
```


##### Ads
Ads can be displayed in the player. To do so, you need to pass the `ads` option to the sdk constructor. In the `ads` object, pass the `adTagUrl` property with the url of the ad tag. The ad tag must be a VAST 2.0 or 3.0 url. For more information about VAST, check the [IAB documentation](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/vast/).

Note: ads are displayed using the [Google IMA SDK](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/quickstart).

##### Responsiveness

With `responsive={true}`, the player height will be automatically set to match the video with/height ratio, depending on the width of player. 

Example

```tsx
{ /* the player width is 160px and response is true: if the video in a 16/9 one, the height of the player will be automatically set to 90px (160 / (16/9)) */}
<ApiVideoPlayer 
  video={{id: "vi5fv44Hol1jFrCovyktAJS9"}}
  style={{width: "160px"}}
  responsive={true} />
```

### Use cases


#### Private videos

To play a [private video](https://api.video/blog/tutorials/tutorial-private-videos/), add the video view token in the video attribute:

```tsx
// ...
<ApiVideoPlayer video={{
  id: "vi5fv44Hol1jFrCovyktAJS9",
  token: "e1bdf9a8-da40-421e-87f3-75b15232c531"}} />
```

#### Defining metadata

```tsx
// ...
<ApiVideoPlayer 
  video={{id: "vi5fv44Hol1jFrCovyktAJS9"}}
  metadata={{"userName": "Alfred"}} />
```

#### Define your own controls

```tsx

const playerRef = useRef<ApiVideoPlayer>(null);

return
<ApiVideoPlayer      
  video={{ id: "vi5jC9kQs2I3PdmVBjgcIg45" }}
  chromeless={true}
  ref={playerRef}>
    <button onClick={() => playerRef.current?.play()}>play</button>
    <button onClick={() => playerRef.current?.pause()}>pause</button>
</ApiVideoPlayer>
```
