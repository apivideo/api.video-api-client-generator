# api.video Android Player

[api.video](https://api.video/) is the video infrastructure for product builders. Lightning fast video APIs for integrating, scaling, and managing on-demand & low latency live streaming features in your app.

## Project description

Easily integrate a video player for videos from [api.video](https://api.video) in your Android
application.
The api.video Android player will help you to play the HLS video from api.video. It also generates
analytics of [your viewers usage](https://api.video/product/video-analytics/).

## Getting started

### Installation

#### Gradle

In your module `build.gradle`, add the following code in `dependencies`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'video.api:android-player:1.5.0'
}
```

For Jetpack Compose, also add the following code in `dependencies`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'video.api:android-compose-player:1.5.0'
}
```

### Retrieve your video Id

At this point, you must have uploaded a least one video to your account. If you haven't
see [how to upload a video](https://docs.api.video/vod/upload-a-video-regular-upload). You'll need
a video Id to use this component and play a video from api.video. To get yours, follow these steps:

1. [Log into your account](https://dashboard.api.video/login) or create
   one [here](https://dashboard.api.video/register).
2. Copy your API key (sandbox or production if you are subscribed to one of
   our [plan](https://api.video/pricing)).
3. Go to [the official api.video documentation](https://docs.api.video/).
4. Go to API Reference -> Videos -> [List all videos](https://docs.api.video/reference/api/Videos#list-all-video-objects)
5. Create a `get` request to the `/videos` endpoint based on the reference, using a tool like Postman.
6. Copy the "videoId" value of one of elements of the API response.

Alternatively, you can find your video Id in the video details of
your [dashboard](https://dashboard.api.video).

### View-based usage

The api.video Android player comes with a view `ApiVideoExoPlayerView` to display the video and its
controller `ApiVideoPlayerController`.

1. Add a `ApiVideoExoPlayerView` to your Activity/Fragment layout:

```xml

<video.api.player.ApiVideoExoPlayerView 
    android:id="@+id/playerView"
    android:layout_width="wrap_content" 
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    app:show_controls="true" 
    app:show_subtitles="true" />
```

You can also use an ExoPlayer `PlayerView` or a `SurfaceView` according to your requirements.
See [Supported player views](#supported-player-views) for more details.

2. Implements the `ApiVideoPlayerController.Listener` interface:

```kotlin
val playerControllerListener = object : ApiVideoPlayerController.Listener {
    override fun onError(error: Exception) {
        Log.e(TAG, "An error happened", error)
    }
    override fun onReady() {
        Log.I(TAG, "Player is ready")
    }
}
```

3. Instantiate the `ApiVideoPlayerController` in an your Activity/Fragment:

```kotlin
val playerView = findViewById<ApiVideoExoPlayerView>(R.id.playerView)

val playerController = ApiVideoPlayerController(
    applicationContext,
    VideoOptions(
        "YOUR_VIDEO_ID",
        VideoType.VOD
    ), // For private video: VideoOptions("YOUR_VIDEO_ID", VideoType.VOD, "YOUR_PRIVATE_VIDEO_TOKEN")
    playerListener,
    playerView
)
```

4. Fullscreen video

If you require a fullscreen video. You will have to implement
the `ApiVideoExoPlayerView.FullScreenListener` interface.
To help you, you can use the `ApiVideoPlayerFullScreenController` that will handle the fullscreen.
As it implements the `ApiVideoExoPlayerView.FullScreenListener` interface, you can pass it to
your `ApiVideoExoPlayerView` instance.

```kotlin
playerView.fullScreenListener = ApiVideoExoPlayerView(
    supportFragmentManager,
    playerView,
    playerController
)
```

Check out for the implementation in the [Sample application](#sample-application).

#### Supported player views

The api.video Android player comes with a specific view `ApiVideoExoPlayerView` to display the video
and its controller. If you require a customization of this view such as changing a button color,...,
you can contact [us](https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-android-player/issues).

Otherwise, in the `ApiVideoPlayerController`, you can also use the following views:

* [`PlayerView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/media3/ui/PlayerView): ExoPlayer
  views from `media3`
* [`SurfaceView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView)
* [`Surface`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/Surface)

The `SurfaceView` and the `Surface` require more work to be used.

### Jetpack compose usage

The api.video Android player comes with a composable `ApiVideoPlayer` to display the video from a
compose application. In your application, you can add:

```kotlin
ApiVideoPlayer(
    videoOptions = VideoOptions("YOUR_VIDEO_ID", VideoType.VOD),
)
```

### Play your api.video video with ExoPlayer, MediaPlayer and VideoView

If you want to use the ExoPlayer directly, you can use the api.video Android extensions:

1. Create a video

```kotlin
val videoOptions = VideoOptions("YOUR_VIDEO_ID", VideoType.VOD)
// For private video: VideoOptions("YOUR_VIDEO_ID", VideoType.VOD, "YOUR_PRIVATE_VIDEO_TOKEN")
```

2. Pass it to your player

For ExoPlayer:

```kotlin
val exoplayer = ExoPlayer.Builder(context).build() // You already have that in your code
exoplayer.addMediaSource(videoOptions)
// Or
exoplayer.setMediaSource(videoOptions)
```

For MediaPlayer:

```kotlin
val mediaPlayer = MediaPlayer() // You already have that in your code
mediaPlayer.setDataSource(context, videoOptions)
```

For VideoView:

```kotlin
val videoView = binding.videoView // You already have that in your code
videoView.setVideo(videoOptions)
```

## Sample application

A demo application demonstrates how to use player.
See [`/examples`](https://github.com/apivideo/api.video-android-player/tree/main/examples)
folder.

On the first run, you will have to set your video Id:

1. Click on the FloatingActionButton -> Settings
2. Replace the video Id with your own video Id
